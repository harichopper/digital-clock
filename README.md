A digital clock is a timekeeping device that displays the current time using digits rather than traditional clock hands. The numbers are usually displayed on an LED or LCD screen and represent the hour, minutes, and sometimes seconds. Some digital clocks may also feature additional information like the date, temperature, or alarms. The design can range from basic and minimalistic to more complex systems with various functionalities such as radio, Bluetooth connectivity, or even voice controls. Digital clocks are powered by batteries, electricity, or solar energy.
